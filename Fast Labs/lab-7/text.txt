There were a fox and an elephant in a forest. The two lived very intimately. so much so that one cannot leave the other. Across the river was a sugarcane field. One day, the elephant wanted to eat sugarcane. The elephant said this to the fox: "Today I want to eat sugarcane," to which the fox replied, "Yes, I also want to eat." "It has been a long day, and I have not eaten."
